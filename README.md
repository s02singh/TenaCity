# Tenacity

## Overview
On average, it typically requires 66 days for a behavior to solidify into a habit, with consistent daily practice often posing a challenge (such as maintaining a daily workout routine). In aiding users in the growth of daily habits, we propose TenaCity, an iOS application designed for tracking habit streaks. Each habit will be represented by a building, and users will find motivation through features like creating a city of buildings and observing their friends' progress in their own cities, with the ability to create group habits with them.
